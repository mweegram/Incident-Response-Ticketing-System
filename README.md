# Incident Response Ticketing System

Upload of the GitHub repo, copied (with credentials, etc) from my Dissertation Project.

The ticketing system designed specifically for Cyber Incident Response has features from false positive statistics, inbuilt Wiki/Guidance and comprehensive ticket linking.

Actions taken can be added as comments, with their stage of the the response they were performed at to generate a response timeline (which in theory could be a Runbook).
